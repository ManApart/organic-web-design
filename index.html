  <div class="game-description">I love games that let you interact with the world. Quest Command is my attempt to remove the effort needed to build a gui, so I can spend more time on deep systems and interacting with the world.</div>

  <div class="game-instructions">
    <div class="game-instructions-title">How to Play</div>
    <div class="game-instructions-description">See the readme to run the game in docker or using the java jar. All commands are typed into the console.</div>

        <a href="https://github.com/ManApart/quest-command" target="_blank">
          <div class="game-iteration-description">My only game that lacks a gui, and not surprisingly the only game I've stuck with a single iteration. Partially also due to using a more modular event based system that requires less full system knowledge to work on.</div>

  <div class="game-description">Inspired by Pokemon and Medabots, battle other bots to acquire parts, and then fit your loadout to the task at hand. The hope is to make each part's ability unique, and also to use it to interact with the environment (swim, climb, break obstacles, etc).</div>

        <a href="https://github.com/ManApart/mechamon" target="_blank">
          <div class="game-iteration-description">Latest iteration, now written with KorGE. With this go I renamed from Automon to Mechamon, and started using KorGE, the first game engine I've really liked and not felt constrained by.</div>

        <div class="game-iteration-name">Scrappers - Spring</div>
        <a href="https://github.com/ManApart/scrappers" target="_blank">
          <div class="game-iteration-description">In this attempt I tried to go for the thinnest possible slice by just focusing on a battle, without a map. I also gave up and used spring and angular to attempt to avoid my gui woes.</div>

        <div class="game-iteration-name">Automon Suit - Zircon</div>
        <a href="https://github.com/ManApart/automon-suit" target="_blank">
          <div class="game-iteration-description">Calling this version automon suit reflected my move to the idea of a wearable suit instead of an autonomous bot. Using Zircon for the front end helped me get the map part up and running quickly, but I still quickly became frustrated with building the gui.</div>

        <div class="game-iteration-name">Automon - JavaFX</div>
        <a href="https://github.com/ManApart/automon-java" target="_blank">
          <div class="game-iteration-description">My second attempt at this game idea, made in java instead of Unity. This attempt used JavaFX for the UI and played with the name 'core gear'. Also worth noting that this was built before I knew about git, and so the history is mostly lost due to a poor port from svn.</div>
